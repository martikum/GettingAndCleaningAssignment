GettingAndCleaningAssignment
============================

The code reads features and activities names.
Reads test and train data variables from files "X_test.txt", "X_train.txt".
Adds subject information from files "subject_test.txt" and "subject_train.txt".
Reads label information from files "y_test.txt" and "y_train.txt". Processes and adds it to test and train datasets.
Binds test and train datasets together.

After it subsets only mean and standard deviation features from the result dataset 
and aggregates mean values of the variables grouping by activity and subject.

The resulting data is then exported into "output.txt" file.

Codebook
========

Here is the the codebook of the resulted dataset.
Value in each column represents the mean value of the corresponding data for each subject and each activity:
